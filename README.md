The primary idea is to create a platform where users can register, connect
with friends, share updates, view posts from friends, and manage their posts. The system utilizes data
structures such as structures and linked lists to represent users, posts, and the relationships between
users. It employs a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
● Allows user registration, login, friend addition, post updates, and viewing posts/friends.

● User registration and login with basic authentication.
● Adding friends updates adjacency lists with mutual connections.
● Posting updates with content limited to 500 characters.
● Viewing a personalized news feed with user and friend posts.
